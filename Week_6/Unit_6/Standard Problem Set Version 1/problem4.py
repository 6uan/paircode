Problem 4: On Repeat
A variation of the two-pointer technique introduced in previous units is to have a slow and a fast pointer that
increment at different rates.

We would like to check whether our playlist loops or not. Given the head of a linked list playlist_head,
return True if the playlist has a cycle in it and False otherwise. 

A linked list has a cycle if at some point in the list, the nodeâ€™s next pointer points back to a previous node in the list.

Evaluate the time and space complexity of your solution. 
Define your variables and provide a rationale for why you believe your solution has the stated time and space complexity.

class SongNode:
	def __init__(self, song, artist, next=None):
		self.song = song
		self.artist = artist
		self.next = next

def on_repeat(playlist_head):
	pass
Example Usage:

Linked list of four songs, with fourth song pointing to second song

song1 = SongNode("GO!", "Common")
song2 = SongNode("N95", "Kendrick Lamar")
song3 = SongNode("WIN", "Jay Rock")
song4 = SongNode("ATM", "J. Cole")
song1.next = song2
song2.next = song3
song3.next = song4
song4.next = song2

print(on_repeat(song1))
Example Output:

True

# Understand: We want to check if our linked list has a cycle in it, in other words if we will visit a previous node at any point

# Plan: If we use fast and slow method we can determine a cycle if at any point our fast and slow pointers are equal?



#     slow:   1            2           3           4
#     fast:   1            3           2           4
#           [song 1] -> [song 2] -> [song 3] -> [song 4]
#                          ^                       |
